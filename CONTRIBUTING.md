## <p align="center">How to Contribute</p>

1. **Fork the repository**  
   - Click the “Fork” button at the top-right corner of the repository page to create your own copy.

2. **Clone your fork locally**  
   - Use `git clone https://github.com/your-username/brightness-markdown-editor.git` to clone your fork.

3. **Create a new branch**  
   - Switch to a new branch for your changes:  
     `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`  
   - Use descriptive branch names like `feature/add-export` or `fix/typo-readme`.

4. **Make your changes**  
   - Implement your feature or fix bugs.  
   - Write clear, maintainable code.  
   - Test your changes thoroughly.

5. **Commit your changes**  
   - Stage your changes: `git add .`  
   - Commit with a meaningful message:  
     `git commit -m "Add export functionality for markdown files"`

6. **Push your branch to your fork**  
   - `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`

7. **Open a Pull Request (PR)**  
   - Go to the original repository on GitHub.  
   - Click “Compare & pull request” next to your branch.  
   - Provide a clear title and description of your changes.

## <p align="center">Guidelines</p>

- Keep pull requests focused — one fix or feature per PR.  
- Follow the existing coding style and conventions of the project.  
- Write clear, concise commit messages (e.g., `Fix: handle null values in user input`).  
- Use descriptive names for branches (e.g., `feature/login-page`, `fix/typo-readme`).  
- Comment your code where logic may not be immediately obvious.  
- Mention related issues with keywords like `Closes #issue-number`.  
- Ensure your changes don’t break existing functionality — test thoroughly.  
- Include screenshots or videos in your PR if your change affects UI or user experience.  
- Be respectful, open to feedback, and constructive during reviews.  
- Document any new features or configuration changes in the README or other relevant files.  
- Run linters or formatters if available.  
- Check that your branch is up to date with the main branch before submitting your PR (`git pull origin main`).  
- Avoid including unrelated changes in a PR.  
- Make sure all automated tests and CI checks pass before requesting review.
