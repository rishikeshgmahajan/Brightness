## <p align='center'>Bug Reports</p>

Please follow the instructions below to submit a clear and actionable bug report. This helps us identify, reproduce, and fix issues more efficiently.

### 1. Check for Existing Reports
Before submitting a bug, search the existing issues to see if someone else has already reported the problem. Duplicate reports can slow down development and clutter the issue tracker.

### 2. Use a Clear and Specific Title
Choose a concise title that summarizes the issue. Avoid vague titles like "It doesn't work" or "Bug found". Instead, describe the issue in a few words.

**Example:**
- "**Fix:** Application crashes when clicking 'Save' with empty input"

### 3. Provide a Detailed Description
Clearly explain what the bug is. Describe what you expected to happen and what actually happened instead. Include any relevant observations or error messages.

**Details to include:**
- What is the bug?
- What did you expect to happen?
- What happened instead?
- If applicable, include the full error message or logs.

### 4. Steps to Reproduce the Bug
Provide a list of steps someone else can follow to reproduce the issue. This is crucial for debugging.

**Example:**
1. Launch the application.
2. Navigate to the 'File' menu.
3. Click on 'Save' without entering any data.
4. Observe the crash or error.

### 5. Include System and Environment Information
Mention the operating system, software version, and any relevant configuration details. This helps us determine if the bug is platform-specific or caused by a particular environment.

**Include the following if possible:**
- Operating System (e.g., Windows 10, macOS 12, Ubuntu 20.04)
- Application version or commit hash
- Python version or other dependencies if applicable

### 6. Attach Screenshots or Logs (If Applicable)
If the bug produces a visible error or output, include screenshots or logs to illustrate the problem. Visual evidence can be very helpful in understanding the issue.

### 7. Optional: Suggest a Possible Fix
If you have insight into the cause of the bug or a potential solution, feel free to describe it. You can also include links to relevant documentation or code references.

*By providing detailed and clear bug reports, you help us resolve issues faster and improve the quality of the project for everyone.*

## <p align='center'>Feature Requests</p>

If you have an idea that could enhance the project, we welcome your feature requests. Please use the format below to submit well-documented and clear suggestions.

### 1. Search for Existing Feature Requests
Before submitting a new request, please check the existing issues to see if someone else has already suggested a similar feature. If so, consider adding your thoughts to that thread instead of creating a new one.

### 2. Use a Clear and Descriptive Title
Provide a concise and descriptive title that clearly summarizes your feature request. Avoid vague titles like "Add this" or "New feature idea".

**Example:**
- "**Feature:** Add dark mode toggle to the user settings menu"

### 3. Describe the Feature in Detail
Clearly explain the feature you are proposing. Describe what it is, how it should work, and what problem it solves or benefit it adds. Be specific and include as much context as possible.

**Details to include:**
- What is the feature?
- Why is it useful or necessary?
- How would it work in the application?
- Are there any examples of similar features elsewhere?

### 4. Provide a Use Case or Scenario
Include a real-world use case that demonstrates how the feature would be used. This helps in understanding the value and practical impact of the feature.

**Example:**
- "As a user who works in low-light environments, I would benefit from a dark mode option to reduce eye strain during extended use."

### 5. Include Any Relevant Mockups or References
If applicable, provide sketches, screenshots, or links to similar implementations. Visuals can help clarify your request and guide development.

### 6. Suggest an Implementation (Optional)
If you have technical insights into how the feature could be implemented, feel free to share them. You can also point to relevant documentation or libraries.

## <p align="center">Guidelines</p>

- Keep pull requests focused — one fix or feature per PR.  
- Follow the existing coding style and conventions of the project.  
- Write clear, concise commit messages (e.g., `Fix: handle null values in user input`).  
- Use descriptive names for branches (e.g., `feature/login-page`, `fix/typo-readme`).  
- Comment your code where logic may not be immediately obvious.  
- Mention related issues with keywords like `Closes #issue-number`.  
- Ensure your changes don’t break existing functionality — test thoroughly.  
- Include screenshots or videos in your PR if your change affects UI or user experience.  
- Be respectful, open to feedback, and constructive during reviews.  
- Document any new features or configuration changes in the README or other relevant files.  
- Run linters or formatters if available.  
- Check that your branch is up to date with the main branch before submitting your PR (`git pull origin main`).  
- Avoid including unrelated changes in a PR.  
- Make sure all automated tests and CI checks pass before requesting review.
